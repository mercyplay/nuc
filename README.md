# nuc

This is my submission for the CAPITAL ONE global visualization competition.

This is a visualization of all nuclear detonations from the first in 1945 and on. Each line represents
a single detonation. The height of the line is the yeild of the bomb.

The heart of the program is nuc_data_mine.py
which produces the json file required for the visualization.
